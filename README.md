The dataset for this project is a countrywide car accident dataset which covers 49 states in US from February 2016 to December 2021.
The dataset was collected from [Kaggle. ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

Accidents were observed from different aspects such as - weather condition, road condition, state, time of the day, weekdays and weekeneds, months, years, etc were taken into consideration. Our primary goal was to create different visalizations and see which of these factors were contributing to the rise of the accidents.
